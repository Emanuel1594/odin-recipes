            <h3> Instructions </h3>
                <h4> Bacon asparagus dippers </h4>
                    <ol> 
                        <li> Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper. </li>
                        <li> Slice each rasher of bacon in half lengthways.  </li>
                        <li> Start at one end of each asparagus spear and wrap a strip of bacon along the length of the asparagus. Place on the baking tray. Repeat with the remaining asparagus and bacon. </li>
                        <li> Bake for 10-15 minutes until the bacon is crispy and the asparagus is tender. </li>
                    </ol>
                <h4> Jammy eggs</h4>
                    <ol start="5">
                        <li> Bring a pot of water to boil over high heat. Carefully poke a tiny hole into the bottom of each egg with an egg pricker or a safety pin. </li>
                        <li> When the water is boiling, lower the eggs into the water and boil for 6 minutes. </li>
                        <li> After 6 minutes, rinse the eggs in cold water. With a sharp knife, crack the top of the egg and cut it off. </li>
                    </ol>
